## ✨ About Me

I'm **Uzzam**, a passionate and self-taught **full-stack developer** who started learning by curiosity and stayed for the love of creating things. I specialize in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and I build everything from simple layouts to dynamic, interactive web experiences.

Even though I’m still early in my journey, I’ve poured my heart into learning and growing every day. I build projects not just to show off — but to **explore, experiment, and express**. My work blends creativity with functionality, and I believe **a great user experience should feel effortless**.

Whether it’s crafting a smooth scroll effect, a responsive layout, or a clean design, I try to make every pixel matter. This portfolio reflects my dedication, my learning path, and my vision as a developer.

## 🧠 What I Believe

> "Learning by doing" is the key to growth.

I'm not from a coding bootcamp. I didn’t attend expensive courses.  
But I’ve built, broken, fixed, and repeated — and that’s how I got here.  

This journey taught me not just how to code, but how to **think**, **problem-solve**, and **build with confidence**.  
My goal is to keep learning and one day inspire others the same way I was inspired.
